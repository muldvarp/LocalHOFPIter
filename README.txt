This is a prototypical implementation exemplifying the concept of local 
higher-order fixpoint iteration. It is written in OCaml. 

Make sure that the executable `ocamlc' is available, and possibly set the
path to it in Makefile. Then execute

> make all

to create executable.. These show the evaluation of a (possibly nested)
higher-order fixpoint formula over particular structures. The examples
are described in the paper "Local Higher-Order Fixpoint Iteration" by
F. Bruse, M. Lange, M. SÃ¤lzer of the University of Kassel, Germany, and
J. Kreiker of the University of Applied Sciences Fulda, Germany. 

- Example 1 formalises a non-context-free reachability problem as an
  order-1 evaluation problem. Usage:

    example1 <n>

  with <n> a natural number. Default is n=2.

- Example 2 formalises a context-sensitive parsing problem as an order-2
  evaluation problem. Usage:

    example2 <s>

  where <s> is a string interpreted as a sequence of tokens for a grammar
  that recognizes words over the alphabet {'b','c','s'} (for 'block', 'code',
  'space'). Default is "bsc". 

- Example 3 formalises a model checking problem for a non-regular property
  as an order-1 evaluation problem. Usage:

    example3 <n>

  with <n> being the number of states of the underlying transition system
  in question. Default is n=2.
